# FlipperBoards

A Vestaboard-style split-flap display application. Run it on a Raspberry Pi connected to a TV, or anywhere Docker runs. Control it from any phone or computer on your network via a mobile-friendly web UI.

---

## Features

- **Authentic split-flap animation** — canvas sprite engine flips every tile through its character ring exactly like the real mechanism, with gravity easing, per-tile timing jitter, Web Audio synthesized clatter, and full-board sweep transitions; smooth even on a Raspberry Pi 3
- **Vestaboard character set** — codes 0–77: A–Z, digits, punctuation, hearts/stars/arrows/shapes (`♥ ★ → ■ ○ °`…), and 7 color tiles
- **Multiple independent screens** — each screen has its own URL, mode rotation, playlist, and WebSocket group; cast any screen to any TV
- **Ten auto-rotation modes** — Clock, Weather, News, Quotes, Calendar, Sports, Countdown, Stocks, Data Feed, Text Messages
- **Content playlist** — arrange any content in any order with per-item durations; mixes modes, custom text, photos, scoreboards, and menus
- **Dayparting** — per-item time windows show a lunch menu at lunch and a dinner menu at dinner, automatically
- **Colored text** — `{red}HAPPY HOUR{/}` markup colors individual letters — something a physical board can't do
- **Image display** — four modes: Photo Split (puzzle), Full Color (RGB mosaic), 8-Color Mosaic (Vestaboard palette), Monochrome (character density)
- **Physical frame mode** — configurable gap width and color between tiles to simulate wooden dowel rods
- **Theming** — 5 built-in presets + custom color pickers for tile text, tile background, and board background
- **REST API** — push any content programmatically
- **Optional password protection** — lock down control so only staff can change the boards; displays stay open
- **WebSocket sync** — all clients on a screen see changes instantly
- **Kiosk mode** — `?kiosk=1` hides all controls for clean TV display
- **Wake Lock** — prevents the TV screen from sleeping while the display view is open

## Self-Hosting

There are two supported self-host options.

---

### Option 1 — Raspberry Pi (bare metal)

**Requirements:** Raspberry Pi 3B+ or newer, Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit recommended), Python 3.11+, Node.js 18+

```bash
# Install Python and Node if needed
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y python3 python3-pip python3-venv
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt install -y nodejs

# Clone and set up
git clone https://github.com/FlipperBoards/FlipperBoards
cd FlipperBoards
chmod +x setup.sh && ./setup.sh
```

**Start the server:**
```bash
cd backend
source .venv/bin/activate
python main.py
```

#### Auto-start with systemd (+ optional auto-update)

```bash
sudo bash deploy/install.sh
```

This installs `flipperboards-backend` (serves the API **and** the built
frontend on port 8000) plus an auto-update timer that pulls new commits,
rebuilds when needed, and restarts. Disable auto-update if you prefer manual
control: `sudo systemctl disable --now flipperboards-updater.timer`.

Useful commands:
```bash
sudo systemctl status flipperboards-backend   # check status
sudo journalctl -u flipperboards-backend -f   # live logs
sudo journalctl -t flipperboards-updater -f   # updater logs
```

---

### Option 2 — Docker

**Requirements:** [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (Mac/Windows) or Docker Engine + Docker Compose (Linux)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FlipperBoards/FlipperBoards
cd FlipperBoards
docker compose up -d
```

That's it. The image builds automatically on first run.

**Data is persisted** in a `./data/` folder next to the compose file:
- `./data/flipperboards.db` — SQLite database (settings, screens, playlists)
- `./data/uploads/` — uploaded photos

```bash
docker compose logs -f         # live logs
docker compose restart         # restart
docker compose pull && docker compose up -d  # update
docker compose down            # stop
```

---

### Option 3 — Unraid

Install from Community Applications (search "FlipperBoards"), or add the
template manually: **Docker → Add Container → Template** and point at
`unraid/FlipperBoards.xml` from this repo. All data lives in
`/mnt/user/appdata/flipperboards`.

---

### Kiosk display clients

The server can run anywhere (Unraid, Docker, a Pi) — anything with a browser
can be a display. Two purpose-built clients are included:

| Client | Where | Setup |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **Pi kiosk** | Raspberry Pi wired to a TV — boots straight into fullscreen Chromium (labwc/Wayland autostart or X11 systemd variants) | [`deploy/pi-kiosk/`](deploy/pi-kiosk/) |
| **Android app** | Android TV, tablets, cheap HDMI sticks | [`android/`](android/) — APK built by CI |

Both point at the server over the network; the display updates live via
WebSocket.

Sharing the Pi with other apps (e.g. a DynaFrame photo frame)? The MQTT
[app controller](deploy/pi-appctl/) switches the TV between FlipperBoards
and other systemd-managed apps — one at a time — and shows up in Home
Assistant automatically.

---

### Accessing the app

Once running (either option), open these URLs — replace `<ip>` with your Pi's IP or `localhost` if running locally:

| URL | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `http://<ip>:8000/display` | Full-screen display — open in the TV's browser |
| `http://<ip>:8000/` | Remote control — open on your phone or computer |
| `http://<ip>:8000/display?screen=lobby` | Display for a named screen |
| `http://<ip>:8000/?screen=lobby` | Remote control for a named screen |
| `http://<ip>:8000/display?kiosk=1` | Kiosk mode — no UI chrome |

**Display tuning parameters** (combine with `&`):

- `scale=0.75` — pin the internal render resolution (upscaled to fit).
- `fps=20` — pin the animation tick rate.
- `renderer=dom` — fall back to the original CSS tile renderer.
- `sound=0` — disable flip sounds for this display.

The display uses a canvas sprite engine: characters flip through the ring
just like a real split-flap mechanism (a scoreboard digit going 2→3 is one
flap; a full message change is a satisfying cascade). Every animation frame
is a handful of pre-rendered sprite blits, drawn on a bounded tick — and the
engine **tunes itself**: if the device can't hold the tick rate it steps down
(30→20 fps, then reduced internal resolution) and remembers the setting for
the next boot. `scale`/`fps` parameters pin it manually instead. Fonts are
bundled, so displays render identically with no internet access.

**Raspberry Pi tip:** on a Pi 3 driving a 1080p TV, set the HDMI output to
720p (`hdmi_mode` in `/boot/firmware/config.txt`) — the TV upscales, every
rendering cost halves, and at TV viewing distance the difference is
invisible.

---

## Quiet Hours

Each screen can sleep on a schedule — a bar's board blanks at closing time and
wakes before opening. Configure per screen in **Screens → edit (✎)**:

- **Off / on times** — overnight windows (off 23:00 → on 08:00) work naturally
- **Days** — which weekdays the off time applies to
- Manual override: the ☾/☀ button on each screen row, `POST
  /api/screens/{id}/sleep {"sleeping": true}`, or MQTT `sleep/set` — holds
  until the next scheduled boundary
- Pushing content to a sleeping screen wakes it

---

## Multiple Screens

Each screen is an independent display with its own mode rotation, playlist, text queue, and WebSocket group. Create and manage screens in the **Screens** tab of the remote control, or via the API:

```bash
curl -X POST http://<ip>:8000/api/screens \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"id":"lobby","name":"Lobby Display","rows":6,"cols":22}'
```

Then open `http://<ip>:8000/display?screen=lobby` on the lobby TV and `http://<ip>:8000/?screen=lobby` on your phone to control it.

---

## Display Modes

Enable and order modes in the **Modes** tab. The rotation interval is set in **Settings**.

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Clock | Live time and date — updates every second |
| Weather | Current conditions via Pirate Weather (key) or Open-Meteo (no key) |
| News | Top headlines — falls back to BBC/Reuters RSS with no API key |
| Quotes | Rotating inspirational quotes (ZenQuotes API or built-in fallback) |
| Calendar | Upcoming events from any iCal URL (Google Calendar, Outlook, etc.) |
| Sports | Live game scores (NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL, college, MLS, EPL) — no API key needed |
| Countdown | Days / hours:minutes:seconds to any date (or count up since one) — seconds tick live |
| Stocks | Stock & crypto prices with % change and green/red direction tiles — no API key needed |
| Data Feed | Poll any JSON URL and render a template — follower counts, sensors, anything |
| Drive Times | Live driving times with traffic to up to 6 destinations (Google Maps key) |
| Text Messages | Custom messages managed in the **Text** tab |

**Sports mode** rotates through the day's games with live scores and game
clocks. Set a **team filter** in the mode's ⚙ config to stay locked on one
game — as the score changes, only the digits flip, just like a real stadium
board. Scores refresh with the rotation interval (60s API cache).

**Countdown mode** counts down to a target date (`2027-01-01 00:00`) with an
optional label and a custom finish message — or counts up *since* a date.
The clock line re-renders every second, so only the second digits flip.

**Stocks mode** takes a comma-separated symbol list (`AAPL, MSFT, BTC-USD` —
Yahoo Finance symbols, crypto included) and shows one row per symbol with the
price, % change vs previous close, and a green/red accent tile per direction.
More symbols than rows pages automatically.

**Data Feed mode** polls any JSON URL every 2 minutes and renders a template
with `{dot.path.0.notation}` placeholders into the response — subscriber
counts, temperature sensors, home-automation values. Example: URL
`https://api.example.com/stats`, template `SUBS {data.followers}`. The server
fetches whatever URL an authenticated operator configures, so treat it like
any admin setting and deploy on a trusted network.

**Drive Times mode** shows live driving times with traffic to up to 6
destinations, one row each with dot leaders and a traffic accent tile —
green (clear), yellow (slow), red (heavy):

```
     DRIVE TIMES
■ HOME··········23 MIN
■ AIRPORT·······41 MIN
■ THE SHOP·······8 MIN
```

Set the **Google Maps API key** in Settings (Routes API enabled on the key),
then the **origin** and **destinations** (`Name | address`, one per line) in
the mode's ⚙ config. Anywhere an address goes, coordinates work too — decimal
(`Home | 45.52, -122.68`) or the DMS format Google Maps copies on right-click
(`Home | 33°26'43.8"N 111°59'21.0"W`). Coordinates skip geocoding entirely,
which is handy for spots without a clean street address. Times refresh **every 5 minutes while displayed** —
fetches only happen when a screen is actually showing the mode, and one
Route Matrix request covers all destinations. Google bills the Route Matrix
per element (destinations × refreshes), so fewer destinations and fewer
display-hours cost less; a board showing 6 destinations 24/7 lands in the
hundreds of dollars per month range, while a few hours a day stays inside
the free credit. Destinations can also be pushed over MQTT (see MQTT
topics) — including ready-made times from Home Assistant's free Waze
integration, which needs no Google key at all.

---

## Content Playlist

The **Playlist** tab builds an ordered sequence of any content type. When the playlist has items it completely replaces the Modes rotation — each item has its own duration and the sequence loops forever.

**Item types:** Mode, Text (custom message), Photo (split across tiles), Score
(live scoreboard), Menu (dot-leader price list)

**Example:** `Text (20s) → Weather (30s) → News (30s) → Text (20s) → Photo (15s) → repeat`

Remove all playlist items to return to the Modes rotation.

### Time windows (dayparting)

Every playlist item can carry a time window (the ⏱ button on its row): start
time, end time, and weekdays. Outside its window the item is skipped —
the rotation flows through the remaining items. A bar's playlist can hold both
the lunch menu (`11:00–16:00`) and the dinner menu (`16:00–23:00`) and always
show the right one. Overnight windows (`22:00–02:00`) work naturally. If
every item is out of its window the board falls back to the clock.

### Menu items

The **Menu** item type renders a title plus name/price entries with
dot leaders and right-aligned prices:

```
      HAPPY HOUR
WELLS··············4.50
DRAFTS·············5.00
WINGS··············9.99
```

More entries than rows paginate each time the item comes around.

### Scoreboard items

The **Score** item type shows two teams with live scores — home team with a
green accent tile, away with red, scores right-aligned:

```
█ HAWKS             12
█ OWLS               7
```

Bump scores from the playlist row's **+/−** buttons, the REST API, or MQTT —
**only the changed digit tiles flip**, everything else stays still. When the
playlist advances to the next game (or any other item), the whole board does a
dramatic full flip sweep.

---

## Image Display

Push an image from the **Image** tab for immediate one-shot display.

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Photo Split | Real photo divided tile-by-tile (puzzle effect) — great for logos on Zoom calls |
| Full Color | Each tile gets its average RGB color — smooth photo mosaic |
| 8-Color Mosaic | Nearest Vestaboard color per tile — bold graphic look |
| Monochrome | Brightness mapped to character density — ASCII art aesthetic |

---

## Physical Frame Mode

Enable in **Settings → Physical Frame**. Simulates wooden dowel rods separating tiles:

- **Divider width** — gap in pixels between tiles (0–20)
- **Divider color** — presets: Black, Dark Wood, Light Wood, Walnut, Steel; or pick any color

---

## REST API

All endpoints accept `?screen=<id>` (default: `main`).

### Push content immediately

```http
POST /api/display/text
{ "text": "HELLO WORLD" }
```
Color individual letters with markup — `{red}HAPPY HOUR{/} 5-7PM` renders
"HAPPY HOUR" in red. Colors: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet, white.
Works in pushed text and playlist text items; the Text tab preview shows it
live.

```http
POST /api/display/matrix
{ "matrix": [[1,2,3,...], ...] }
```
Character codes: `0`=blank, `1–26`=A–Z, `27–36`=1–0, `71–77`=color tiles

```http
POST /api/display/color-matrix
{ "color_matrix": [["#ff0000","#00ff00",...], ...] }
```

```http
POST /api/display/photo          # multipart/form-data, field: file
POST /api/display/mode           # { "mode": "clock", "duration": 60 }

## Security

FlipperBoards is designed for **trusted private networks** (home, office, bar).
By default there is no login. If untrusted people share the network — e.g. a
venue with guest Wi-Fi — enable password protection in **Config → Security**:

- **Control requires login** — the remote UI and every mutating API call
  (`POST`/`PUT`/`DELETE`) need a session; staff sign in once per device
  (sessions last 30 days)
- **Displays stay open** — TVs, kiosks, and read-only API calls work without
  a login, so wall-mounted screens survive reboots unattended
- Passwords are stored as salted PBKDF2 hashes; changing the password signs
  everyone out

API clients authenticate with `POST /api/auth/login {"password": "..."}` and
the returned `fb_session` cookie. MQTT is governed by your broker's own
credentials, not this password.

Do not expose FlipperBoards directly to the internet — for remote access use
a VPN or an authenticating reverse proxy.

---

## MQTT & Home Assistant

Enable in **Config → MQTT / Home Assistant** (broker host/port/credentials).
Everything the REST API can do, MQTT can do — from Home Assistant, Node-RED,
or a plain `mosquitto_pub`.

### Command topics

Base topic is configurable (default `flipperboards`); `<sid>` is the screen id
(`main` unless you've added screens).

| Topic | Payload |
|-------|---------|
| `flipperboards/<sid>/text/set` | `HELLO WORLD` or `{"text":"HI","duration":30}` |
| `flipperboards/<sid>/matrix/set` | `{"matrix":[[...codes...]],"duration":30}` |
| `flipperboards/<sid>/design/set` | design name, id, or `{"design":"My Design","duration":60}` |
| `flipperboards/<sid>/image/set` | library image id/name or `{"image":12,"duration":60}` |
| `flipperboards/<sid>/mode/set` | mode id — `clock`, `weather`, `news`, … |
| `flipperboards/<sid>/blank/set` | anything |
| `flipperboards/<sid>/sleep/set` | `on` \| `off` — manual quiet-hours override |
| `flipperboards/<sid>/playlist/set` | `next` \| `play` \| item index (`2`) |
| `flipperboards/<sid>/scoreboard/set` | `{"home_score":3}` — partial updates OK |
| `flipperboards/<sid>/scoreboard/<item_id>/set` | same, targeting a specific playlist item |
| `flipperboards/<sid>/drivetime/set` | `[{"name":"HOME","dest":"123 Main St"}]` (computed via Google) or `[{"name":"HOME","minutes":23,"traffic":"heavy"}]` (ready-made, e.g. HA Waze); `clear` returns to the configured list |

### State topics (published, retained)

| Topic | Payload |
|-------|---------|
| `flipperboards/bridge/availability` | `online` / `offline` (last will) |
| `flipperboards/<sid>/state` | `{"mode","rows","cols","playlist_pos","playlist_len"}` |
| `flipperboards/<sid>/mode` | current mode string |
| `flipperboards/<sid>/text/state` | last pushed text |

### Examples

```bash
mosquitto_pub -h <broker> -t flipperboards/main/text/set -m 'DINNER IS READY'
mosquitto_pub -h <broker> -t flipperboards/main/mode/set -m weather
mosquitto_pub -h <broker> -t flipperboards/main/scoreboard/set -m '{"home_score":2,"away_score":1}'
mosquitto_pub -h <broker> -t flipperboards/main/playlist/set -m next
```

### Home Assistant discovery

With **HA Discovery** enabled (default), each screen announces itself via MQTT
discovery and appears in Home Assistant as a device — no YAML:

- **Message** (text entity) — type a message, it appears on the board
- **Mode** (select) — switch between clock/weather/news/…
- **Next** (button) — advance the playlist
- **Blank** (button) — clear the display

Note: after a text/image push the mode state may show values not in the select
options (e.g. `text_push`) — HA displays the select as unknown until a real
mode is active again.

## Development

```bash
# Backend tests + lint
pip install -r backend/requirements-dev.txt
cd backend && pytest tests && ruff check .

# Frontend dev server (proxies /api and /ws to :8000)
cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev
```

CI runs the test suite and a production frontend build on every push and PR.
See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for how to get involved, and
[PLUGINS.md](PLUGINS.md) for writing custom display modes.
